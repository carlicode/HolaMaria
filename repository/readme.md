# How it works:

Hello Maria is available every day. When a student calls the bot that is connected in Twilio, the server connected in the Azure cloud makes a call to the knowledge API in which it processes the message of the interlocutor, transforms it from speech to text, and does the search in the Web. Once the desired result is found, the bot transforms the text into speech to respond to the student.

# Core Technologies

 <h3 style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; ">Microsoft Azure</h3> 
Microsoft Azure, commonly referred to as Azure, is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and supports many different programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems. Azure is the largest commercial cloud vendor by revenue, although that designation stems in part from the company's "power of incumbency in Office 365 Commercial and Microsoft 365," which may artificially inflate the company's "pure cloud" revenue totals.

Azure, announced at Microsoft's Professional Developers Conference (PDC) in October 2008, went by the internal project codename "Project Red Dog", and formally released in February 2010, as Windows Azure before being renamed to Microsoft Azure on March 25, 2014.


 <h3 style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; ">Azure Functions</h3>
Azure Functions is an event driven, compute-on-demand experience that extends the existing Azure application platform with capabilities to implement code triggered by events occurring in Azure or third party service as well as on-premises systems.


<h3 style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; ">Twilio</h3>
Twilio is an American cloud communications platform as a service company based in San Francisco, California. Twilio allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs.
